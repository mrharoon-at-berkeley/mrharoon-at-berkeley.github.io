    <h2 class="Lessons">Grit and perserverence</h2>
    <p>
      No one understands what grit and perseverance are and how to develop them. I think it's a 'self-fulfilling
      prophecy' kind of thing. I know many people who achieve difficult accomplishments by working hard, but their
      mindset is delusional. That's not to say they are crazy or bad peopleâ€”I mean to say that what they think is
      unrealistic, like 'God will take me there if I work hard enough!' Maybe, but likely not. Those who envision and go
      at it, even for what feels like a lifetime, have true grit.
